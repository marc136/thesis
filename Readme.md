##Abstract
Goal is to both research and implement a multipoint communication solution that uses WebRTC for audio and video transmission. The conference size should be arbitrary but support at least four participants and allow multiple conferences at the same time. The solution should contain recording functionality and allow participation of devices in restrictive network environments.  

These goals were met by using a a media server that allows to significantly increase the conference size from the maximum of four when using a full mesh peer-to-peer architecture.  

This thesis is separated into two parts: The first consists of an introduction to WebRTC, research and theoretical assumptions that lead to an implementation strategy. The second part contains information about the selected media server, follows the implementation of the prototype solution and describes parts of its architecture.  

The prototype itself is not part of this thesis.  

Included are benchmark results for WebRTC conferences concerning the bandwidth requirements for different multipoint architecture patterns and screen resolutions. Those were conducted using the prototype application.
