Basis of this thesis was the plan to create a multi party communication solution using the peer-to-peer technology WebRTC.\par
This first part contains the definition and reasoning for the goals of the solution, an introduction to WebRTC, benefits of using a media server and a section about different components needed to achieve the set goals and create a working prototype.\par
The second part starting on page~\pageref{part:2} contains information about the implementation of the simucos prototype.


\section{Definition of goals}
\label{sec:define-goals}
Before starting on the rationale for the prototype, the goals need to be defined:
\begin{description}
\item{\textbf{Goal is a WebRTC conferencing prototype that}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{allows more than four participants to communicate simultaneously}
	\item{supports recording of conversations}
	\item{allows participants in restrictive network environments to take part in conversations}
	\item{optionally allows SIP-Clients (soft/hard phones), and Teleconferencing systems to connect to a conference}
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}
