The prototype of a WebRTC multipoint conferencing solution for more than four participants that allowed recording using a Media Server was implemented as simucos - \textbf{si}mple \textbf{mu}ltipoint \textbf{co}nferencing \textbf{s}olution.\\
As depicted in figure~\ref{fig:simucos-architecture-overview} it consists of a media server, a signaling application on the server and a web application on the client's side.
