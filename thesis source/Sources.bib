This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in browsers - {\dq}real time communication on the Web{\dq}. It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable, and that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully specified and on the right publication track. This document is an Applicability Statement - it does not itself specify any protocol, but specifies which other specifications RTCWEB compliant implementations are supposed to follow.
This document is a work item of the RTCWEB working group.},

 abstract = {Scope:
Enabling real-time communications between Web browsers require the following client-side technologies to be available:
API functions to explore device capabilities, e.g. camera, microphone, speakers (currently in scope for the Device APIs {\&} Policy Working Group)
API functions to capture media from local devices (camera and microphone) (currently in scope for the Device APIs {\&} Policy Working Group)
API functions for encoding and other processing of those media streams,
API functions for establishing direct peer-to-peer connections, including firewall/NAT traversal
API functions for decoding and processing (including echo cancelling, stream synchronization and a number of other functions) of those streams at the incoming end,
Delivery to the user of those media streams via local screens and audio output devices (partially covered with HTML5)

Out of Scope:
The definition of the network protocols used to establish the connections between peers is out of scope for this group; in general, it is expected that protocols considerations will be handled in the IETF.
The definition of any new codecs for audio and video is out of scope.},
